# The Invisible Supply Chain: LLMs and Their Training Data

## Introduction

In 1984, Ken Thompson delivered his famous Turing Award lecture titled "Reflections on Trusting Trust," revealing a disturbing truth about computer security. Thompson demonstrated how a compiler—the tool that translates human-readable code into machine instructions—could be compromised to insert invisible backdoors into any program it compiled, including new versions of itself. The most chilling aspect? These backdoors would be undetectable through source code review. As Thompson famously concluded: "You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself."

Four decades later, as artificial intelligence reshapes our technological landscape, Thompson's warning takes on new significance. The invisible threat has evolved from compromised compilers to something potentially more pervasive: the data that trains our Large Language Models (LLMs).

Today's LLMs are trained on vast datasets scraped from the internet, books, code repositories, and other sources—often terabytes or petabytes in size. This training data forms an invisible supply chain that few users ever see but that fundamentally shapes the behavior, biases, and security properties of the resulting models. Just as Thompson's compromised compiler could recognize specific code patterns to exploit, modern LLMs could potentially inherit biases, backdoors, or vulnerabilities present in their training data.

What makes this problem particularly concerning is the unprecedented opacity of this data supply chain. While traditional software supply chains have gradually developed integrity checks, provenance tracking, and verification methods, the AI ecosystem is still catching up. Most LLM users have zero visibility into what data was used for training, how it was validated, what filtering was applied, or who had access to modify it.

In this chapter, we'll explore the security implications of this invisible supply chain, examine potential attack vectors, analyze real-world cases, and discuss emerging approaches to establishing trust in an era where, as Thompson might say, no one can claim to have "totally created" the data that shapes AI behavior.

## Technical Background

To understand the security challenges posed by LLM training data, we must first examine how these models work and why their relationship with training data is so fundamental. Unlike traditional software, which executes explicit instructions written by humans, LLMs learn statistical patterns from massive datasets through a process called training. This statistical nature creates an entirely different security paradigm.

LLMs are typically developed through a multi-stage process. First, the model undergoes pre-training on a broad corpus of text data, learning the statistical patterns of language. This data commonly includes web pages, books, articles, code repositories, and other publicly available text. The scale is staggering—models like GPT-4 are trained on hundreds of billions to trillions of tokens (word pieces). This initial training creates a general-purpose model that can generate text and code but may not be aligned with human preferences.

Subsequent stages often include fine-tuning on more specific datasets and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where human evaluators rate model outputs to further refine behavior. Each stage represents a point where the data supply chain can influence model behavior, intentionally or unintentionally.

Data collection and curation for LLMs typically involve web crawling, licensing of text corpora, filtering for quality and safety, deduplication, and preprocessing. Most large models use proprietary datasets with limited public documentation about sources or filtering criteria. Even open-source models rarely provide complete transparency about their training data due to both practical limitations and intellectual property concerns.

The concept of data poisoning—deliberately manipulating training data to induce specific behaviors in ML systems—has been studied for over a decade. Early research demonstrated how carefully crafted malicious examples could cause image classifiers to misclassify specific targets or create backdoor behaviors triggered by specific patterns. These attacks have grown more sophisticated over time, with researchers demonstrating techniques like "clean-label" poisoning that can evade detection methods.

Data provenance—tracking the origin, chain of custody, and transformations of data—is a well-established concept in domains like scientific research and legal evidence. However, its application to AI training data remains nascent. The sheer scale and diverse sources of LLM training data make traditional provenance tracking challenging, creating a fundamental security blindspot in the AI development pipeline.

## Core Problem/Challenge

The technical challenge of the invisible data supply chain manifests in several interconnected ways, each presenting unique security concerns for LLM development and deployment.

At the most fundamental level, the statistical learning process that makes LLMs powerful also creates an expansive attack surface. Unlike traditional software vulnerabilities that require specific code paths to be exploited, LLM vulnerabilities can emerge from statistical patterns learned during training. A malicious actor doesn't need to compromise the model architecture itself—they only need to influence a statistically significant portion of the training data or exploit the model's tendency to memorize rare but distinctive patterns.

Several types of training data compromises are technically possible:

**Data Poisoning Attacks**: Adversaries could deliberately inject malicious examples into training datasets. For code-generating models, this might include contributing code with subtle vulnerabilities to open-source repositories likely to be scraped for training. For general-purpose models, it could involve creating websites with harmful content specifically designed to be incorporated into training data. The statistical nature of learning means these attacks can be effective even if the poisoned data represents a small fraction of the overall dataset.

**Backdoor Implantation**: More sophisticated attacks could implant backdoors that are only triggered by specific inputs. For example, a model might be trained to generate secure code in most cases but insert vulnerabilities when a particular phrase or pattern appears in the prompt. These attacks are particularly concerning because they can remain dormant until activated and may evade standard evaluation methods.

**Memorization Exploitation**: LLMs are known to occasionally memorize specific examples from their training data, especially unusual or repeated content. This property could be exploited by embedding malicious content in formats likely to be memorized, creating a vector for data exfiltration or targeted attacks.

**Bias Amplification**: Less deliberate but equally problematic is how models can amplify biases present in training data. These biases can manifest as unfair treatment of certain groups, perpetuation of stereotypes, or systematic errors in specific domains—all of which create security and ethical concerns.

The "black box" nature of commercial LLMs exacerbates these challenges. Most deployed models provide limited visibility into their architecture, training methodology, or data sources. Even when models are open-sourced, their training data rarely is, creating a fundamental asymmetry: users can inspect the model weights but not the data that shaped them.

Traditional security measures like code review, static analysis, and penetration testing are ill-equipped to address these challenges. These tools were designed for deterministic software systems where vulnerabilities exist in specific locations within code. In contrast, LLM vulnerabilities can be distributed across billions of parameters, emergent from the interaction of countless training examples, and triggered by statistical rather than logical patterns.

The result is a security blindspot that grows more significant as LLMs become more deeply integrated into critical systems and workflows.

## Case Studies/Examples

While public documentation of successful training data attacks against commercial LLMs remains limited—due to both the novelty of the threat and the opacity of model development—several real and hypothetical examples illustrate the potential vulnerabilities.

### Case Study 1: The GitHub Copilot Controversy

When GitHub Copilot was released, researchers quickly discovered that the code-generating AI occasionally reproduced verbatim snippets from its training data, including code with known security vulnerabilities and content with restrictive licenses. While not a malicious attack, this case demonstrated how training data can directly influence model outputs in ways developers might not anticipate. Example outputs included SQL queries vulnerable to injection attacks and authentication routines with hardcoded credentials—vulnerabilities that would propagate to any application incorporating the suggested code.

```python
# Vulnerable code suggested by an LLM
def authenticate(username, password):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "'"
    result = database.execute(query)
    return len(result) > 0
```

This simple example demonstrates SQL injection vulnerability that could be generated based on patterns in training data.

### Case Study 2: Hypothetical Supply Chain Poisoning

Consider a sophisticated adversary targeting a language model expected to be used in security-critical applications. Rather than attacking the model directly, they contribute to open-source projects likely to be included in training data. Their contributions include code that appears secure but contains subtle vulnerabilities activated by specific patterns.

For example, they might contribute encryption libraries that contain backdoors only triggered when specific parameter values are used—values they later plan to suggest when interacting with the trained model. The attack sequence would look like:

1. Contribute backdoored code to repositories likely to be scraped for training
2. Wait for the code to be incorporated into training datasets
3. When the model is deployed, prompt it to generate code using the specific trigger patterns
4. Result: The model produces code that appears secure but contains exploitable flaws

### Case Study 3: Bias and Reliability in Medical Contexts

A more subtle but equally important case involves unintentional biases in training data. Researchers evaluating an LLM for medical applications discovered it provided significantly different quality of advice depending on patient demographics mentioned in queries. Investigation revealed the model was trained predominantly on medical literature reflecting historical disparities in research focus and care quality across different populations. While not a deliberate attack, this case illustrates how training data composition directly impacts model reliability and safety.

### Case Study 4: The Adversarial Data Filtering Problem

When developing content filters for an LLM, a team discovered that filtering "toxic" content from training data had an unexpected effect: it reduced the model's ability to identify and discuss toxic content reliably. By removing examples of harmful content from training, they had inadvertently created a model less capable of recognizing such content when asked to analyze it. This highlights the complex tradeoffs in training data curation and the potential for security mechanisms to create new vulnerabilities through unexpected statistical effects.

These cases illustrate a common pattern: the invisible nature of the training data supply chain creates security vulnerabilities that traditional development practices are not designed to detect or mitigate.

## Impact and Consequences

The security implications of compromised or problematic training data extend across technical, business, ethical, and regulatory domains, creating multi-dimensional risks for organizations deploying LLMs.

From a technical security perspective, the consequences can be severe and difficult to detect. Unlike traditional software vulnerabilities that can be patched once discovered, issues stemming from training data are embedded in the fundamental behavior of the model. Addressing them typically requires retraining with clean data—a process that can be costly, time-consuming, and potentially impossible if the original training data wasn't properly archived or if the sources of contamination cannot be identified.

Detection presents another challenge. Traditional security tools look for known patterns of malicious behavior, but LLM vulnerabilities may manifest as statistically anomalous outputs under specific conditions rather than consistent, reproducible bugs. This makes traditional testing methodologies inadequate and necessitates new approaches to security validation.

Business impacts extend beyond direct security breaches. Organizations deploying compromised models may face:

- **Reputational damage** when models produce harmful, biased, or incorrect outputs
- **Legal liability** for damages caused by model outputs, particularly in regulated industries
- **Intellectual property concerns** when models reproduce copyrighted content from training data
- **Competitive disadvantages** if proprietary information leaks through model responses
- **Remediation costs** that can far exceed initial development costs

The ethical dimensions are equally significant. Models that perpetuate biases from training data can cause real harm to individuals and communities. Those that generate misleading information or manipulative content can damage social trust and democratic processes. Organizations deploying such systems face growing scrutiny about their ethical responsibilities for model outputs.

The regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving in response to these risks. The EU's AI Act, China's regulations on algorithmic recommendations, and proposed legislation in the United States all address aspects of AI transparency, accountability, and safety. Organizations deploying models with opaque training data face increasing compliance challenges as these regulations mature.

For critical systems, the stakes are particularly high. An LLM used to generate code, develop security policies, or design system architectures could introduce vulnerabilities that propagate throughout an organization's technology stack. Unlike traditional security breaches that might be contained to specific systems, these vulnerabilities could be architectural in nature, affecting entire classes of applications or infrastructure.

The cascade effect is perhaps most concerning: as LLMs are increasingly used to generate content that may itself become training data for future models, problems can amplify over time rather than diminish. This creates the potential for a problematic feedback loop where vulnerabilities become entrenched in the AI ecosystem.

As Ken Thompson warned about compilers, you cannot trust code you did not create yourself. In the age of LLMs trained on internet-scale data, this problem is magnified exponentially: no organization can claim to have "totally created" the data that shapes their AI systems' behavior.

## Solutions and Mitigations

Addressing the invisible supply chain challenge requires a multi-layered approach combining technical, organizational, and ecosystem-level strategies. While no single solution can completely eliminate the risks, several approaches can significantly reduce them.

### Technical Approaches

**Data Provenance Tracking**: Implementing cryptographic signing and verification for training data can create an auditable trail of data sources, transformations, and usage. Projects like DataSheets for Datasets and Model Cards propose standardized documentation practices, while emerging technologies like data lineage tools allow organizations to track data from source to model.

```json
# Example of a simplified data provenance entry
{
  "data_source": "Common Crawl 2022-05",
  "hash": "sha256:7d9fe6a5fd48f48e5bd96c35f1717e1b271f5cda75ac47698ec4f2f68015fc67",
  "filtering_applied": ["PII removal", "toxic content filtering"],
  "transformation_pipeline": "github.com/organization/data-preprocessing/commit/abc123",
  "validation_metrics": {
    "quality_score": 0.87,
    "diversity_score": 0.72,
    "bias_evaluation": "github.com/organization/bias-eval/report/2022-06-15"
  },
  "signed_by": "0x3F2A4B1C..."
}
```

**Adversarial Data Validation**: Applying techniques from adversarial machine learning to proactively identify potentially malicious training examples. These approaches include outlier detection, consistency checking across data sources, and explicit testing for known attack patterns in training data.

**Red-Team Testing**: Conducting specialized penetration testing focused on attempting to exploit potential training data vulnerabilities. This includes testing for prompt injection, data exfiltration, and backdoor triggers—providing early warning of potential issues.

**Federated Learning and Differential Privacy**: Employing privacy-enhancing technologies that limit the exposure of raw training data and protect against certain classes of data poisoning attacks. These approaches can reduce the attack surface while still allowing effective model training.

### Organizational Strategies

**Risk-Based Data Curation**: Implementing tiered approaches to data validation based on the sensitivity of the intended model use case. Critical applications warrant more intensive verification of training data sources and content.

**Decision Framework for Data Sources**:

| Data Source Type | Verification Level | Recommended Controls | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public web data | Basic | Automated filtering, statistical anomaly detection | General-purpose models with human oversight |
| Curated datasets | Enhanced | Source verification, manual sampling, bias analysis | Models for sensitive but non-critical applications |
| Verified proprietary data | Comprehensive | Full provenance tracking, adversarial validation, chain of custody | Safety-critical or security applications |

**Responsible AI Governance**: Establishing clear roles, responsibilities, and processes for training data management. This includes defining acceptable data sources, verification procedures, and response protocols for discovered issues.

### Ecosystem-Level Approaches

**Standardization**: Supporting industry standards for training data documentation, verification, and exchange. Initiatives like the Partnership on AI's ABOUT ML project propose frameworks for improving transparency in model development.

**Independent Auditing**: Engaging third-party experts to evaluate training data practices and model behavior. This provides an additional layer of validation beyond internal processes.

**Open Research**: Contributing to the development of better detection and mitigation techniques through participation in research communities and open publication of methods and findings.

### Implementation Checklist for Security Teams

- [ ] Document all training data sources and preprocessing steps
- [ ] Implement cryptographic verification for data pipeline integrity
- [ ] Conduct regular audits of training data for potential contamination
- [ ] Develop and test response plans for discovered data vulnerabilities
- [ ] Create feedback mechanisms to detect anomalous model behaviors in production

While these approaches cannot eliminate all risks, they represent significant improvements over current practices and form the foundation of a more trustworthy AI development ecosystem.

## Future Outlook

The challenge of securing the LLM training data supply chain will likely evolve along several trajectories in the coming years, shaped by technological innovation, regulatory pressures, and changing threat landscapes.

On the technical front, we can expect significant advances in verifiable training methodologies. Current research in areas like cryptographic commitments for dataset verification, zero-knowledge proofs for data transformations, and formal verification of training processes points toward more rigorous approaches to data integrity. These technologies could eventually enable "verifiable training" where model developers can prove claims about their training data without necessarily disclosing the data itself—balancing transparency with intellectual property concerns.

The emergence of specialized validation tooling is another likely development. Just as application security evolved from manual code review to sophisticated static and dynamic analysis tools, we may see automated systems capable of detecting statistical anomalies, poisoned examples, and potential backdoors in training datasets. These tools could become as fundamental to AI development as vulnerability scanners are to software development today.

The threat landscape will undoubtedly grow more sophisticated. As defensive capabilities mature, adversaries will likely develop more subtle attacks designed to evade detection. One particularly concerning possibility is the emergence of "slow poison" attacks that introduce biases or vulnerabilities gradually across multiple data sources, making them harder to detect through statistical analysis. The potential for state-level actors to attempt strategic compromise of widely used training datasets also represents a significant evolution of the threat model.

Regulatory frameworks will continue to mature, with increasing emphasis on traceability and accountability. The EU AI Act already introduces requirements for documentation of high-risk AI systems, including training methodologies and data sources. Similar regulations are likely to emerge globally, potentially creating a complex compliance landscape for organizations deploying models across multiple jurisdictions.

Industry responses will likely include the development of trusted data sources and certification mechanisms. We may see the emergence of "verified data pools" for LLM training—curated datasets with established provenance and security validation that become the gold standard for developing models in regulated or safety-critical domains.

The relationship between open and closed approaches to AI development will significantly impact security practices. Open-source models with transparent training methodologies offer the benefit of community scrutiny but may also provide adversaries with more information about potential attack vectors. Closed, proprietary systems might be harder to directly analyze but could implement more robust security controls. Most likely, a hybrid ecosystem will emerge with different approaches serving different use cases.

For organizations developing or deploying LLMs, the future will require more sophisticated risk management frameworks specifically designed for AI systems. These frameworks will need to account for the unique characteristics of statistical learning systems while integrating with existing security practices. Security teams will need new skills and tools to effectively evaluate model risks, potentially creating new specializations within the cybersecurity profession.

Education and awareness will play crucial roles as well. As understanding of these risks becomes more widespread, we should expect increased demand for transparency from model providers. This market pressure could drive voluntary improvements in data governance practices even in the absence of regulatory requirements.

The most significant shift may be philosophical: a move from viewing AI models as software products to understanding them as the outputs of complex data supply chains. This perspective change could fundamentally alter how organizations approach AI security, placing greater emphasis on upstream data controls rather than focusing exclusively on model behavior.

As Ken Thompson warned us about trusting compilers, the next generation of security professionals may warn us about trusting training data. The solution, however, will not be to abandon these powerful technologies but to develop new frameworks of verification and validation appropriate to their unique characteristics.

## Conclusion

The invisible supply chain of LLM training data represents one of the most significant and least addressed security challenges in modern AI development. As we've seen throughout this chapter, the data that shapes AI behavior creates vulnerabilities that traditional security approaches are ill-equipped to detect or mitigate.

Ken Thompson's seminal work on "Trusting Trust" provided a powerful metaphor for understanding this challenge: just as a compromised compiler could perpetuate undetectable backdoors, compromised training data can create models with built-in vulnerabilities, biases, or backdoors. The key difference is scale—while Thompson's compiler attack required sophisticated knowledge and targeted intervention, the massive datasets used for LLM training create an exponentially larger attack surface with far more potential entry points.

Key takeaways for security professionals, ML engineers, and AI safety researchers include:

1. **Acknowledge the blindspot**: Recognize that training data represents a fundamental security blindspot in current AI development practices. Invisibility does not equal security.
2. **Implement data governance**: Develop comprehensive data governance frameworks that address the entire lifecycle of training data, from collection through preprocessing to usage and retention.
3. **Adopt verification practices**: Implement technical and procedural controls to verify the integrity and provenance of training data, particularly for models used in sensitive or safety-critical applications.
4. **Prepare for incidents**: Develop response plans for scenarios involving compromised training data, including detection strategies, containment approaches, and remediation processes.
5. **Engage with the ecosystem**: Participate in industry and research initiatives aimed at developing standards, tools, and best practices for training data security.

Organizations deploying LLMs face a choice: they can treat these models as black boxes and accept the inherent risks of the invisible supply chain, or they can demand greater transparency and implement appropriate controls to mitigate these risks. As LLMs become more deeply integrated into critical systems and processes, the latter approach becomes increasingly essential.

The path forward requires balancing innovation with security, leveraging the tremendous capabilities of these models while implementing appropriate guardrails. It requires new technical approaches, organizational practices, and ecosystem-level coordination. Most importantly, it requires a recognition that in AI, as in traditional software, security cannot be an afterthought—it must be designed in from the beginning, starting with the data that shapes everything that follows.

As we move to the next chapter, we'll explore another critical dimension of trust in AI systems: the challenges of verifying model behavior across the vast input space these systems can encounter. The invisible supply chain of training data is just the beginning of the trust challenge—but addressing it creates the foundation for more trustworthy AI development.
