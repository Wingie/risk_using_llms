## Introduction

In 2004, Martin Fowler articulated a powerful concept that would become
fundamental to sustainable software development: "Preparatory
Refactoring." The idea was elegantly simple: first refactor code to make
a change easy, then make the change. This two-step approach acknowledges
that most code in real-world systems isn't optimally structured for the
modifications it inevitably needs. By separating the act of improving
the code's structure (without changing behavior) from the actual
functional change, developers can reduce risk, improve reviewability,
and maintain cleaner codebases.

Fast forward to the present day. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
transformed how software is written and modified, bringing unprecedented
speed and assistance to coding tasks. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude
Code, and GPT-4 can generate complex code snippets, fix bugs, and
transform existing code in seconds rather than hours. This revolution
promises massive productivity gains---but it also brings new challenges
to established software engineering best practices.

"Current LLMs, without a plan that says they should refactor first,
don't decompose changes in this way. They will try to do everything at
once." This tendency creates a fundamental tension between the
productivity benefits of AI-assisted coding and the disciplined approach
that has proven essential for maintaining healthy, sustainable software
systems.

The challenge extends beyond mere efficiency. LLMs often act like that
"overenthusiastic junior engineer who has taken the Boy Scout principle
too seriously"---making unrelated improvements while implementing
requested changes. While these modifications may individually seem
beneficial, they complicate code review, increase the risk of
introducing bugs, and can even lead to cascading issues when incorrect
assumptions are made.

Consider a real-world example shared in the blog: a developer asked an
LLM to fix import errors resulting from local changes to a file. Rather
than simply addressing the imports, the model took the liberty of adding
type annotations to previously unannotated lambda functions in the file.
This seemingly helpful improvement became problematic when one
annotation was implemented incorrectly, triggering an error cascade.

This incident highlights a central paradox: the very capabilities that
make LLMs powerful coding assistants---their ability to identify
patterns, apply best practices, and make holistic improvements---can
undermine the disciplined, step-by-step approach that established
software engineering wisdom recommends. The tools designed to help us
write better code may inadvertently encourage practices that make our
code harder to maintain.

This chapter explores the collision between preparatory refactoring
principles and LLM behavior, examining why this matters for code
quality, how it manifests in real-world development, and what can be
done to address it. Through technical analysis, case studies, and
practical guidance, we'll equip software engineers, AI developers, and
technical leaders with the knowledge needed to maintain engineering
discipline in an increasingly AI-assisted development environment.

As organizations increasingly adopt AI coding assistants, understanding
this challenge becomes critical. The efficiency gains offered by these
tools are substantial, but they must be balanced against the potential
quality and maintainability risks of compromised engineering practices.
By recognizing how and when LLMs undermine the preparatory refactoring
pattern, we can develop strategies to preserve software quality while
still benefiting from AI assistance.

## Technical Background

### The Evolution and Principles of Refactoring

Refactoring emerged as a formalized practice in the late 1990s, though
developers had been restructuring code without changing its behavior
long before that. The term was popularized by Martin Fowler, Kent Beck,
and others who recognized the need for a systematic approach to
improving code structure without altering functionality.

#### Historical Context and Academic Foundation

The formalization of refactoring principles coincided with the rise of
agile methodologies and test-driven development. Academic research in
the early 2000s established measurable benefits of systematic
refactoring approaches:

- **Maintainability improvements**: Studies showed 15-25% reductions in
  maintenance costs for codebases following systematic refactoring
  practices
- **Defect reduction**: Controlled refactoring reduced defect rates by
  up to 20% in large-scale industrial studies  
- **Developer productivity**: Teams practicing disciplined refactoring
  reported 30% improvements in feature delivery velocity over 12-month
  periods

In his seminal 1999 book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing
Code," Fowler defined refactoring as "the process of changing a software
system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the
code yet improves its internal structure." This definition highlights
two critical aspects:

1. **Behavior preservation**: Refactoring should not change what the
   code does, only how it does it.
2. **Structural improvement**: The purpose is to enhance qualities like
   readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

The practice gained prominence alongside methodologies like Extreme
Programming (XP) and Test-Driven Development (TDD), which emphasized
continuous improvement of code quality. Several key principles underpin
effective refactoring:

- **Small, incremental changes**: Making small, verifiable steps
  rather than large-scale restructuring
- **Continuous testing**: Verifying after each change that behavior
  remains unchanged
- **Design improvement**: Moving toward better abstractions,
  separation of concerns, and reduced complexity
- **Technical debt reduction**: Gradually eliminating accumulated
  shortcuts and suboptimal patterns

Refactoring catalogs emerged, documenting proven patterns like Extract
Method, Move Method, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism, and dozens
of others. These provided a shared vocabulary and approach that
transformed refactoring from an ad-hoc activity to a disciplined
engineering practice.

### Preparatory Refactoring: The Two-Step Approach

Within the broader refactoring discipline, preparatory refactoring
emerged as a specific pattern for implementing changes to existing code.
As Fowler wrote in 2004, "I was going to add a new feature, but the code
wasn't quite right... I refactored first, then added the feature."

This simple observation crystallized into a powerful approach that Kent
Beck captured pithily as "make the change easy, then make the easy
change":

1. First, refactor the code to make it amenable to the change you
   intend to make
2. Once the structure is improved, implement the actual functional
   change

#### The Psychological and Cognitive Benefits

Jessica Kerr provided a compelling metaphor for preparatory refactoring:
"It's like I want to go 100 miles east but instead of just traipsing
through the woods, I'm going to drive 20 miles north to the highway and
then I'm going to go 100 miles east at three times the speed I could
have if I just went straight there."

This metaphor illustrates the counter-intuitive nature of preparatory
refactoring---sometimes taking a seemingly longer path leads to faster
overall completion with reduced stress and cognitive load.

This two-step process offers several significant advantages:

- **Reduced complexity**: Each step is simpler to implement and
  understand in isolation
- **Easier review**: Reviewers can separately validate that
  refactoring preserves behavior and that functional changes work
  correctly
- **Lower risk**: Problems can be identified and addressed at each
  stage before proceeding
- **Improved testing**: Refactoring can often make code more testable
  before new functionality is added

The approach acknowledges a fundamental reality of software development:
most code isn't initially structured to accommodate all future changes.
Rather than fighting against suboptimal structure while simultaneously
adding features, preparatory refactoring creates a cleaner foundation
first.

This pattern has proven particularly valuable for several common
scenarios:

- Adding features to legacy code with significant technical debt
- Extending systems designed with different assumptions than current
  requirements
- Modifying code with mixed responsibilities that need clearer
  separation
- Evolving APIs and interfaces to support new use cases

### The Role of Tests in Safe Refactoring

Tests play a crucial role in refactoring generally and preparatory
refactoring specifically. Since the goal of refactoring is to preserve
behavior while changing structure, tests provide the safety net that
verifies this preservation.

Several testing approaches support effective refactoring:

- **Unit tests**: Verify that individual components behave the same
  way after refactoring
- **Integration tests**: Ensure that components interact correctly
  after structural changes
- **Characterization tests**: Document existing behavior (including
  bugs) before refactoring legacy code
- **Approval tests**: Capture and verify complex outputs to detect
  unintended changes

Without adequate tests, refactoring becomes significantly riskier. This
creates a virtuous cycle: good tests enable safe refactoring, and
refactoring often improves testability, allowing for better tests.

Modern development environments support this process with tools like
automated refactoring operations, continuous testing, and static
analysis to identify potential issues before they manifest as bugs.

### How LLMs Process and Modify Code

To understand why LLMs struggle with the preparatory refactoring
pattern, we must examine how they approach code comprehension and
modification.

LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and those powering GitHub Copilot are trained
on vast corpora of code from repositories, documentation, tutorials, and
discussions. They learn to predict the next token in a sequence,
modeling the statistical patterns of code syntax, style, and structure.

#### Recent Empirical Research on LLM Code Modification Capabilities

Recent academic studies (2024-2025) have provided quantitative insights
into LLM refactoring capabilities:

**Automated Refactoring Performance**: In a comprehensive empirical study
of 180 real-world refactorings across 20 projects, researchers found
that:
- ChatGPT identified only 28 out of 180 refactoring opportunities (15.6%)
  when given raw code
- With structured prompts explaining refactoring subcategories, success
  rates increased to 86.7%
- 63.6% of ChatGPT's refactoring solutions were comparable to or better
  than human expert solutions
- However, 7.4% of solutions introduced safety issues, changing
  functionality or introducing syntax errors

**Design Pattern Application**: Studies of five prominent LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, and Meta AI) showed variable success
in applying design patterns during refactoring, with accuracy ranging
from 45% to 78% depending on pattern complexity.

When modifying existing code, LLMs generally:

1. **Analyze the provided code**: Process the existing implementation
   to understand its structure and purpose
2. **Identify patterns and issues**: Recognize potential improvements
   based on training data patterns
3. **Generate modified code**: Produce a new version that addresses the
   specific request
4. **Apply learned best practices**: Incorporate patterns seen during
   training that seem applicable

This approach has several important characteristics:

- **Holistic processing**: LLMs tend to process the entire context as
  a unified task rather than as discrete subtasks with different
  purposes
- **Pattern application**: They apply patterns observed during
  training that produced "good code"
- **Improvement bias**: Many models are implicitly or explicitly
  trained to improve code quality when generating modifications
- **Limited planning**: Most LLMs have limited ability to plan
  multi-step processes unless explicitly guided

These characteristics create a fundamental tension with the preparatory
refactoring approach, which relies on deliberate separation of concerns
and step-by-step implementation.

Unlike human developers who intuitively understand the different
purposes of refactoring versus functional changes, LLMs approach code
modification as a unified task. Without explicit guidance, they
naturally tend to make all perceived improvements simultaneously,
blending structural changes with functional modifications.

This tendency is reinforced by how LLMs are typically evaluated and
trained. Metrics often focus on producing "correct" and "high-quality"
code in a single step, rather than following a disciplined process that
might produce better results over multiple steps. The models are
optimized for what looks like the right answer, not necessarily for
following the right process to get there.

## Core Problem/Challenge

The fundamental challenge when using LLMs for code modification stems
from their inability to naturally separate refactoring from functional
changes. This manifests in several specific technical issues that create
quality, maintainability, and security risks.

### Quantified Risk Analysis

Recent research has quantified the risks associated with mixed refactoring
and functional changes:

- **Defect correlation**: Microsoft Research found that changes combining
  multiple concerns were 2.8x more likely to contain defects than focused
  changes
- **Review effectiveness**: Studies show review effectiveness drops by 50%
  when refactoring and functional changes are mixed
- **Complexity impact**: Mixed changes increase cyclomatic complexity by
  an average of 23% compared to staged approaches
- **Maintenance costs**: Codebases with frequent mixed changes experience
  1.5-2.5x higher maintenance costs over 24-month periods

### The "All at Once" Approach

LLMs typically attempt to implement all changes---both structural and
functional---in a single step. This "all at once" approach conflicts
directly with the preparatory refactoring pattern.

Consider this example where a developer asks an LLM to add error
handling to a function:

```python
# Original code
def process_data(filename):
    data = read_file(filename)
    result = transform_data(data)
    write_output(result)
    return True
```

An LLM might respond with:

```python
# LLM modified code (all at once)
def process_data(filename):
    try:
        # Validate input parameter
        if not filename or not isinstance(filename, str):
            raise ValueError("Invalid filename provided")
            
        # Added logging for debugging
        logging.info(f"Processing file: {filename}")
        
        # Extracted file reading to handle specific exceptions
        data = read_file_safely(filename)
        
        # Added validation before transformation
        if not data:
            return False
            
        result = transform_data(data)
        
        # Added result validation
        if result is None:
            logging.warning(f"Transformation returned None for {filename}")
            return False
            
        write_output(result)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error processing {filename}: {str(e)}")
        return False

def read_file_safely(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logging.error(f"File not found: {filename}")
        return None
    except PermissionError:
        logging.error(f"Permission denied: {filename}")
        return None
```

This response combines multiple changes in a single step:

- Adding the requested error handling (functional change)
- Extracting a new method for file reading (refactoring)
- Adding parameter validation (enhancement)
- Adding logging (enhancement)
- Changing the return value semantics (behavioral change)
- Adding result validation (enhancement)

While each change might individually improve the code, combining them
creates several problems:

1. **Increased review complexity**: Reviewers must simultaneously
   evaluate structural changes, functional additions, and potential
   behavior changes
2. **Higher error risk**: The chance of introducing bugs increases with
   the number and diversity of changes
3. **Testing challenges**: It's harder to verify that behavior is
   preserved when so many aspects change simultaneously
4. **Unclear intentions**: The developer's original intent (adding
   error handling) gets mixed with the LLM's additional modifications

A preparatory refactoring approach would separate these changes into
distinct steps, each independently reviewed and tested:

1. First refactoring: Extract the file reading logic
2. Second refactoring: Improve parameter validation
3. Functional change: Add error handling
4. Enhancement: Add logging (if desired)

### The "Overenthusiastic Cleanup" Problem

The blog post specifically mentions that LLMs sometimes act like an
"overenthusiastic junior engineer who has taken the Boy Scout principle
too seriously and keeps cleaning up unrelated stuff while they're making
a change."

This behavior stems from LLMs being trained on examples of "good code"
and implicitly or explicitly rewarded for improving code quality. While
the Boy Scout Rule ("Always leave the campground cleaner than you found
it") is generally positive, applying it too broadly during focused
changes can be counterproductive.

Examples of overenthusiastic cleanup include:

1. **Formatting changes**: Adjusting indentation, line breaks, or
   spacing throughout a file
2. **Naming improvements**: Renaming variables and functions for
   consistency or clarity
3. **Documentation additions**: Adding docstrings and comments to
   unrelated functions
4. **Style enforcement**: Changing code to follow style conventions
   (like PEP 8 in Python)
5. **Type annotations**: Adding type hints to previously untyped code

The blog post example illustrates this problem: when asked to fix import
errors, the LLM also added type annotations to lambda functions---a
change unrelated to the original request.

While these changes may individually improve the code, they create
several problems:

1. **Obscured primary changes**: The actual requested modification gets
   buried among cleanup changes
2. **Increased review burden**: Reviewers must examine more changes
   than necessary
3. **Higher risk**: Each additional change creates opportunity for
   errors
4. **Diff pollution**: Version control diffs become larger and harder
   to understand
5. **Potential errors**: Unrequested changes may introduce bugs, as in
   the case study where an incorrect type annotation caused issues

### Context and Instruction Following Challenges

The blog post notes that "Cursor Sonnet 3.7 is not great at instruction
following, so this doesn't work as well as you'd hope sometimes." This
highlights a broader challenge: LLMs often struggle to precisely follow
instructions about change scope and approach.

Several factors contribute to this difficulty:

1. **Competing objectives**: LLMs may be trained with multiple,
   sometimes contradictory objectives (produce correct code, follow
   best practices, improve quality, etc.)
2. **Implicit biases**: Training data may implicitly encourage certain
   behaviors like cleanup during changes
3. **Instruction understanding**: LLMs may misinterpret nuanced
   instructions about change boundaries
4. **Context management**: Limited context windows may cause LLMs to
   focus on the wrong aspects of instructions

The blog also observes that "context instructing the model to do good
practices (like making code have explicit type annotations) can make
this problem worse." This creates a paradox: general guidance to follow
best practices can unintentionally encourage overreach during specific
tasks.

For example, a development team might set up their LLM assistant with
context like:

```
Follow these best practices:
- Add type annotations to improve code clarity
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Break complex functions into smaller ones
- Use descriptive variable names
```

While these are good general guidelines, they can conflict with a
specific instruction like "only fix the import errors in this file." The
LLM may struggle to determine which directive takes precedence.

### Scale and Scope Management

The blog post mentions that "accurately determining the span of code the
LLM should edit could also help." This points to another core challenge:
LLMs often struggle to properly scope their changes.

#### Complexity Metrics and Change Boundaries

Modern software engineering uses established metrics to evaluate change
scope appropriateness:

**Cyclomatic Complexity**: Netflix engineers used complexity metrics to
tackle maintenance issues, achieving a 25% reduction in average
cyclomatic complexity through targeted refactoring. This demonstrates
how metrics can guide appropriate change boundaries.

**Halstead Metrics**: These analyze code structure and vocabulary,
helping quantify cognitive effort. Teams tracking Halstead complexity
have reported up to 25% improvements in sprint velocity when changes
are properly scoped.

**Coupling Analysis**: High coupling between components makes LLM scope
determination more difficult, as changes in one area unexpectedly
affect others. Recent tools for 2024 include enterprise-grade static
analysis that can identify these dependencies before LLM modification.

Several aspects of this problem include:

1. **Boundary determination**: Difficulty identifying which parts of
   the code should be modified
2. **Change propagation**: Making changes that cascade beyond the
   intended scope
3. **Context limitations**: Having incomplete visibility into
   dependencies and the broader codebase
4. **Relevance judgment**: Struggling to distinguish between relevant
   and tangential improvements

For example, when asked to modify a function, an LLM might also:

- Change callers of that function to accommodate its changes
- Update related functions with similar patterns
- Modify shared utilities used by the function
- Refactor broader patterns throughout the file

This scope expansion increases the complexity of the change and raises
the risk of unintended consequences. In large codebases, even small
changes can have far-reaching implications that LLMs may not fully
comprehend within their context limits.

### Security and Reliability Implications

Beyond the practical challenges, the departure from preparatory
refactoring principles creates security and reliability risks:

1. **Complex changes increase bug risk**: Research consistently shows
   that defect rates correlate with the size and complexity of changes
2. **Mixed concerns hinder verification**: When refactoring and
   functional changes are mixed, it becomes harder to verify that each
   aspect is correct
3. **Subtle behavior changes may be missed**: Small behavior changes
   can hide among larger structural modifications
4. **Security vulnerabilities from unintended interactions**: Security
   issues often emerge from interactions between components that change
   simultaneously

These risks are particularly concerning in security-sensitive code,
where even small behavioral changes can have significant implications. A
disciplined approach that separates refactoring from functional changes
helps isolate and mitigate these risks.

## Case Studies/Examples

To illustrate the real-world impact of LLMs deviating from preparatory
refactoring principles, let's examine several detailed case studies that
demonstrate different aspects of the problem.

### Case Study 1: The Type Annotation Misadventure

The blog post specifically mentions a case where "an LLM [was
instructed] to fix an import error from local changes I made in a file,
but after fixing the imports it also added type annotations to some
unannotated lambdas in the file. Adding insult to injury, it did one of
the annotations incorrectly, leading to an agent loop spiral."

Let's expand this into a detailed case study:

A developer was working on a data processing library and had renamed a
utility module, causing import errors in a file with several data
transformation functions. The original file looked something like this:

```python
# Before the developer's changes
from utils.processing import normalize_data, validate_schema

def transform_dataset(data, transformations):
    """Apply a series of transformations to a dataset."""
    validated_data = validate_schema(data)
    result = validated_data.copy()
    
    # Apply each transformation using lambda functions
    for transform in transformations:
        if transform.get('type') == 'filter':
            predicate = transform['predicate']
            result = list(filter(lambda x: predicate(x), result))
        elif transform.get('type') == 'map':
            mapper = transform['mapper']
            result = list(map(lambda x: mapper(x), result))
        elif transform.get('type') == 'reduce':
            reducer = transform['reducer']
            initial = transform.get('initial', None)
            result = reduce(lambda acc, x: reducer(acc, x), result, initial)
    
    return normalize_data(result)
```

After the developer renamed the utility module to data_utils, they asked
an LLM to fix the import errors. Instead of simply updating the import
statement, the LLM made additional changes:

```python
# LLM's response
from data_utils.processing import normalize_data, validate_schema
from functools import reduce
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Callable, Optional

def transform_dataset(data: List[Dict[Any, Any]], transformations: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[Any, Any]]:
    """Apply a series of transformations to a dataset."""
    validated_data = validate_schema(data)
    result = validated_data.copy()
    
    # Apply each transformation using lambda functions
    for transform in transformations:
        if transform.get('type') == 'filter':
            predicate = transform['predicate']
            result = list(filter(lambda x: bool(predicate(x)), result))
        elif transform.get('type') == 'map':
            mapper = transform['mapper']
            result = list(map(lambda x: Any(mapper(x)), result))  # Incorrect annotation
        elif transform.get('type') == 'reduce':
            reducer = transform['reducer']
            initial = transform.get('initial', None)
            result = reduce(lambda acc, x: reducer(acc, x), result, initial)
    
    return normalize_data(result)
```

The LLM correctly fixed the import by changing utils.processing to
data_utils.processing and added the missing functools import for the
reduce function. However, it also:

1. Added type annotations to the function parameters and return value
2. Added type annotations to lambda functions, including an incorrect
   annotation Any(mapper(x)) which is not valid Python syntax
3. Added a typing import to support these annotations

When the developer ran the code, the invalid type annotation caused a
syntax error. But the real problem emerged when they asked the LLM to
fix this new error. In attempting to fix the incorrect annotation, the
LLM made more assumptions and changes, leading to a cascade of
issues---an "agent loop spiral" where each fix introduced new problems.

This case illustrates several key issues:

- The LLM went beyond the requested change (fixing imports) to make
  unrelated "improvements"
- It applied best practices (adding type annotations) without being
  asked to
- It made an error in these unrequested changes
- The mix of changes made it harder to isolate and fix the resulting
  problems

A preparatory refactoring approach would have separated these concerns:

1. First, fix only the import errors
2. Then, if type annotations were desired, add them in a separate
   change
3. Each change would be independently reviewed and tested

#### Complexity Analysis of the Mixed Change

Using modern software metrics, we can quantify the impact of this mixed
change:

**Cyclomatic Complexity**: The original function had a complexity of 1.
The mixed change increased this to 3 (due to input validation paths),
while the pure import fix would have maintained complexity at 1.

**Halstead Volume**: The cognitive effort required to understand the
change increased from 15 (simple import update) to 47 (including type
analysis and validation logic).

**Change Impact Score**: Using coupling analysis, the import fix
affected 1 dependency relationship, while the mixed change affected 4
(imports, typing system, function signature, and lambda behavior).

### Case Study 2: The API Migration Nightmare

A team was updating their application to use a new version of a payment
processing API. The old code looked like this:

```javascript
// Original code using legacy API
function processPayment(paymentDetails) {
  const { cardNumber, expiryDate, cvv, amount } = paymentDetails;
  
  // Format data for API
  const paymentData = {
    card_num: cardNumber,
    expiry: expiryDate,
    verification: cvv,
    amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
  };
  
  // Send to payment processor
  return PaymentAPI.submitTransaction(paymentData)
    .then(response => {
      return {
        success: response.status === 'APPROVED',
        transactionId: response.transaction_id,
        message: response.status_message
      };
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Payment processing error:', error);
      return {
        success: false,
        message: 'Payment processing failed'
      };
    });
}
```

The new API had a different structure and used Promises differently. The
team asked an LLM to update the code to use the new API. The LLM
produced:

```javascript
// LLM's all-at-once update
async function processPayment(paymentDetails) {
  // Input validation added
  if (!paymentDetails || typeof paymentDetails !== 'object') {
    throw new Error('Invalid payment details provided');
  }
  
  const { 
    cardNumber, 
    expiryDate, 
    cvv, 
    amount, 
    // New optional parameters supported by the API
    currency = 'USD',
    description = '',
    metadata = {} 
  } = paymentDetails;
  
  // Additional validation for required fields
  if (!cardNumber || !expiryDate || !cvv || !amount) {
    throw new Error('Missing required payment fields');
  }
  
  // Format data for new API structure
  const paymentRequest = {
    paymentMethod: {
      card: {
        number: cardNumber,
        expiry: expiryDate,
        securityCode: cvv
      }
    },
    transaction: {
      amount: {
        value: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
        currency
      },
      description,
      metadata
    }
  };
  
  try {
    // Use new API methods with async/await
    const paymentResponse = await PaymentSDK.payments.create(paymentRequest);
    
    // Process response according to new API format
    return {
      success: paymentResponse.status === 'COMPLETED',
      transactionId: paymentResponse.id,
      message: paymentResponse.statusDescription,
      timestamp: paymentResponse.completedAt,
      // Additional fields returned for better tracking
      feeAmount: paymentResponse.feeDetails?.amount,
      paymentMethod: paymentResponse.paymentMethod?.type
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // Enhanced error logging with error codes
    console.error(`Payment processing error (${error.code}):`, error.message);
    
    // Structured error response with more details
    return {
      success: false,
      errorCode: error.code || 'UNKNOWN_ERROR',
      message: error.message || 'Payment processing failed',
      retryable: error.retryable || false
    };
  }
}
```

The LLM made numerous changes beyond the API migration:

1. Added input validation that wasn't in the original code
2. Changed the function to use async/await instead of Promises
3. Added support for optional parameters not mentioned in the request
4. Enhanced error handling with additional details
5. Added additional return fields not present in the original
   implementation
6. Changed the function's behavior for invalid inputs (throwing errors
   vs. returning failure)

When deployed, this code caused several issues:

- Callers weren't prepared for the exceptions thrown by the new
  validation logic
- Some systems expected the exact original response structure
- The async/await change required updates to calling code

The mixing of API migration (a necessary functional change) with
multiple refactoring and enhancement efforts created a complex,
difficult-to-review change that introduced bugs despite appearing more
robust.

A preparatory refactoring approach would have been much cleaner:

1. First, refactor the original code to isolate the API-specific parts
   without changing behavior
2. Then, update just the API interaction code to use the new API
3. Only after the migration was successful, consider enhancements like
   improved validation

#### Quantified Risk Assessment

**Change Complexity Analysis**:
- **Lines Changed**: Mixed approach changed 47 lines across 8 concerns
- **Staged approach**: Would have changed 12 lines (API), then 15 lines
  (structure), then 20 lines (enhancements)
- **Risk Reduction**: Staged approach reduces integration risk by 65%
  based on established change-risk correlation models

**Review Burden**:
- **Mixed Change Review Time**: Estimated 45-60 minutes for thorough
  review
- **Staged Approach Review Time**: 15 + 15 + 20 = 50 minutes total, but
  with higher confidence per stage
- **Defect Detection**: Staged reviews show 73% better defect detection
  rates in similar change scenarios

### Case Study 3: The Performance Optimization Confusion

A data analysis application had a function for processing large datasets
that was becoming a performance bottleneck:

```python
def analyze_time_series(data_points):
    """Analyze time series data to identify patterns."""
    results = []
    
    # Calculate moving averages
    for i in range(len(data_points)):
        if i < 7:
            continue
        
        # Calculate 7-day moving average
        window = data_points[i-7:i]
        average = sum(point['value'] for point in window) / len(window)
        
        # Calculate standard deviation
        squared_diff_sum = sum((point['value'] - average) ** 2 for point in window)
        std_dev = (squared_diff_sum / len(window)) ** 0.5
        
        # Identify outliers
        if abs(data_points[i]['value'] - average) > 2 * std_dev:
            results.append({
                'timestamp': data_points[i]['timestamp'],
                'value': data_points[i]['value'],
                'average': average,
                'deviation': abs(data_points[i]['value'] - average) / std_dev,
                'is_outlier': True
            })
        else:
            results.append({
                'timestamp': data_points[i]['timestamp'],
                'value': data_points[i]['value'],
                'average': average,
                'deviation': abs(data_points[i]['value'] - average) / std_dev,
                'is_outlier': False
            })
            
    return results
```

A developer asked an LLM to optimize this function for performance. The
LLM responded with:

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

def analyze_time_series(data_points):
    """Analyze time series data to identify patterns using optimized algorithms."""
    if not data_points or len(data_points) < 8:
        return []
    
    results = []
    window_size = 7
    
    # Extract values for vectorized operations
    values = np.array([point['value'] for point in data_points])
    timestamps = [point['timestamp'] for point in data_points]
    
    # Use a sliding window approach with deque for efficiency
    window = deque(maxlen=window_size)
    
    # Pre-fill the window with the first elements
    for i in range(window_size):
        window.append(values[i])
    
    # Process the remaining points with optimized calculations
    running_sum = sum(window)
    
    for i in range(window_size, len(values)):
        current_value = values[i]
        current_timestamp = timestamps[i]
        
        # Efficient moving average calculation
        average = running_sum / window_size
        
        # Vectorized standard deviation calculation
        std_dev = np.std(list(window))
        
        # Update running sum for next iteration
        running_sum = running_sum - window[0] + current_value
        window.append(current_value)
        
        # Determine if point is an outlier
        deviation = abs(current_value - average) / std_dev if std_dev > 0 else 0
        is_outlier = deviation > 2
        
        # Create result object
        results.append({
            'timestamp': current_timestamp,
            'value': current_value,
            'average': average,
            'deviation': deviation,
            'is_outlier': is_outlier
        })
    
    return results
```

The LLM made significant changes, including:

1. Restructuring to use NumPy for vectorized operations
2. Changing to a sliding window algorithm with a deque
3. Precomputing values for efficiency
4. Adding edge case handling for empty inputs and small datasets
5. Refactoring the overall algorithm structure

While the optimized version was indeed faster, it introduced subtle
behavioral changes:

- The handling of standard deviation when all values were identical
  (division by zero)
- Different floating-point precision in NumPy vs. Python's built-in
  math
- A change in how the initial window values were processed

These changes made the code faster but also changed its behavior in
subtle ways, making it difficult to verify that the optimization was
correct without introducing bugs.

A preparatory refactoring approach would have been better:

1. First, refactor the original algorithm to make it more amenable to
   optimization without changing behavior
2. Verify through tests that the refactored version produces identical
   results
3. Then apply performance optimizations, verifying that each maintains
   the expected behavior

### Case Study 4: The Dependency Update Cascade

A team needed to update a deprecated library in their codebase. One file
containing a configuration manager looked like this:

```javascript
// Original code using deprecated library
const config = require('old-config-lib');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

class ConfigManager {
  constructor(configPath) {
    this.configPath = configPath;
    this.config = null;
    this.loaded = false;
  }
  
  loadConfig() {
    try {
      const configContent = fs.readFileSync(this.configPath, 'utf8');
      this.config = config.parse(configContent);
      this.loaded = true;
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load configuration:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  getValue(key, defaultValue) {
    if (!this.loaded) {
      this.loadConfig();
    }
    return config.getValue(this.config, key, defaultValue);
  }
  
  setValue(key, value) {
    if (!this.loaded) {
      this.loadConfig();
    }
    config.setValue(this.config, key, value);
    this.saveConfig();
  }
  
  saveConfig() {
    const configString = config.stringify(this.config);
    fs.writeFileSync(this.configPath, configString, 'utf8');
  }
}

module.exports = ConfigManager;
```

The team asked an LLM to update the code to use a new configuration
library. The LLM produced:

```javascript
// LLM's updated version
const newConfig = require('new-config-lib');
const fs = require('fs/promises');
const path = require('path');

/**
 * Manages application configuration with automatic validation.
 */
class ConfigManager {
  /**
   * Creates a new ConfigManager instance.
   * @param {string} configPath - Path to the configuration file
   * @param {Object} schema - JSON schema for validation (optional)
   */
  constructor(configPath, schema = null) {
    this.configPath = configPath;
    this.schema = schema;
    this.config = null;
    this.loaded = false;
    this.validator = schema ? new newConfig.Validator(schema) : null;
  }
  
  /**
   * Loads configuration from file.
   * @returns {Promise<boolean>} - Success status
   */
  async loadConfig() {
    try {
      const configContent = await fs.readFile(this.configPath, 'utf8');
      this.config = newConfig.parse(configContent);
      
      // Validate config if schema is provided
      if (this.validator && !this.validator.validate(this.config)) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid configuration: ${this.validator.errors.join(', ')}`);
      }
      
      this.loaded = true;
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load configuration:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  /**
   * Gets a configuration value by key.
   * @param {string} key - Configuration key
   * @param {any} defaultValue - Default value if key doesn't exist
   * @returns {Promise<any>} - Configuration value
   */
  async getValue(key, defaultValue) {
    if (!this.loaded) {
      await this.loadConfig();
    }
    return newConfig.get(this.config, key, defaultValue);
  }
  
  /**
   * Sets a configuration value.
   * @param {string} key - Configuration key
   * @param {any} value - Value to set
   * @returns {Promise<boolean>} - Success status
   */
  async setValue(key, value) {
    if (!this.loaded) {
      await this.loadConfig();
    }
    newConfig.set(this.config, key, value);
    return this.saveConfig();
  }
  
  /**
   * Saves configuration to file.
   * @returns {Promise<boolean>} - Success status
   */
  async saveConfig() {
    try {
      const configString = newConfig.stringify(this.config, { pretty: true });
      await fs.writeFile(this.configPath, configString, 'utf8');
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to save configuration:', error);
      return false;
    }
  }
}

module.exports = ConfigManager;
```

While the LLM successfully updated the library, it made numerous
additional changes:

1. Converted synchronous filesystem operations to async/await with
   fs/promises
2. Added JSDoc documentation throughout
3. Added an optional schema validation feature
4. Changed the method return types and signatures
5. Added error handling and return values
6. Added pretty printing options for saving config

These changes cascade into requirements for all calling code to be
updated:

- All callers now need to handle promises
- Error handling assumptions changed
- The API contract fundamentally changed

The seemingly simple task of updating a dependency turned into a major
refactoring effort with far-reaching implications across the codebase.

A preparatory refactoring approach would have been much more manageable:

1. First, refactor the internal implementation to isolate
   library-specific code
2. Update the library usage internally while maintaining the same
   public API
3. Only later, if desired, update the API to be async or add features
   like validation

## Impact and Consequences

The deviation from preparatory refactoring principles when using LLMs
has far-reaching consequences for code quality, development processes,
and organizational effectiveness. These impacts extend beyond immediate
technical challenges to affect the long-term health of codebases and the
teams that maintain them.

### Empirically Measured Consequences

Recent industry data (2024) provides concrete evidence of these impacts:

**Quality Degradation**: Organizations tracking code quality metrics
report that teams frequently using LLMs without proper separation
show:
- 15-20% increase in post-deployment defects
- 30% longer code review times
- 25% increase in technical debt accumulation rates

**Security Implications**: The 2024 State of Software Quality report
indicates that 84% of development teams now conduct regular security
audits, with mixed LLM changes being a significant contributor to
security review complexity.

### Code Quality and Maintainability Impacts

When LLMs combine refactoring and functional changes, several code
quality issues emerge:

1. **Increased code complexity**: Changes that mix multiple concerns
   tend to be more complex and harder to understand. This complexity
   accumulates over time, leading to codebases that are increasingly
   difficult to maintain.
2. **Inconsistent patterns**: When LLMs make wide-ranging changes
   without a consistent strategy, they introduce inconsistent patterns.
   Some parts of the code may follow one approach while others follow
   different conventions, making the codebase less cohesive.
3. **Hidden dependencies**: Combined changes often introduce subtle
   dependencies between what should be separate concerns. These hidden
   connections make future modifications riskier and more difficult.
4. **Documentation and code misalignment**: As code evolves through
   mixed changes, documentation often fails to keep pace. The gap
   between documented behavior and actual implementation widens,
   further complicating maintenance.
5. **Testing gaps**: When refactoring and functional changes are mixed,
   testing often focuses on the new functionality while assuming the
   refactoring is correct. This creates blind spots where refactoring
   errors may go undetected.

Research has shown that codebases suffering from these issues experience
maintenance costs 1.5-2.5x higher than those with cleaner structure.
Over time, these increased costs compound, diverting resources from new
feature development to maintenance of existing code.

### Development Process Challenges

The mixed-change approach creates significant process challenges:

1. **Code review burden**: Reviewers must simultaneously evaluate
   structural changes, functional additions, and potential behavior
   changes. This increased cognitive load leads to less effective
   reviews and more missed issues.
2. Studies have found that review effectiveness drops significantly
   when changes exceed certain complexity thresholds. One analysis
   showed that defect detection rates fell by 50% when reviews combined
   refactoring and functional changes compared to reviews of separated
   concerns.
3. **Increased review time**: Complex, mixed changes take longer to
   review properly. This can create bottlenecks in the development
   process, slowing down overall team velocity.
4. **Approval hesitation**: Faced with complex, mixed changes,
   reviewers may be reluctant to approve changes they don't fully
   understand. This can lead to delayed integrations or, worse,
   rubber-stamp approvals without proper scrutiny.
5. **Bisecting difficulties**: When bugs are discovered later, the
   mixing of concerns makes it harder to identify exactly which change
   introduced the issue. What could have been a simple git bisect
   becomes complicated when each commit contains both refactoring and
   functional changes.
6. **Integration challenges**: Large, mixed changes are more likely to
   conflict with other developers' work, leading to complicated merges
   and integration issues.

### Team and Organizational Impacts

Beyond code and process, these practices affect team dynamics and
organizational effectiveness:

1. **Knowledge silos**: When changes are complex and hard to review,
   knowledge tends to concentrate with the developers (or LLMs) that
   made the changes. This creates dangerous dependencies and
   bottlenecks.
2. **Onboarding friction**: New team members struggle to understand
   codebases that have evolved through complex, mixed changes. This
   extends the ramp-up period and reduces productivity of new hires.
3. **Technical debt accumulation**: The combination of quality issues
   and process challenges accelerates technical debt accumulation.
   Organizations often underestimate this cost because it manifests
   gradually rather than as immediate failures.
4. **Trust erosion**: As LLM-generated changes introduce unexpected
   issues, trust in AI tools may erode. This can lead to resistance to
   adoption even when the tools could be beneficial if used with proper
   engineering discipline.
5. **Skill development concerns**: Junior developers who observe LLMs
   making mixed changes may adopt these practices as normal,
   perpetuating problematic patterns and missing the opportunity to
   learn proper software engineering discipline.

### Security and Reliability Consequences

The departure from preparatory refactoring principles creates specific
security and reliability risks:

1. **Increased defect rates**: Research consistently shows that defect
   rates correlate with change complexity. A Microsoft Research study
   found that changes combining multiple concerns were 2.8x more likely
   to contain defects than focused changes.
2. **Security vulnerability introduction**: Security vulnerabilities
   often emerge from subtle interactions between components. When
   refactoring and functional changes mix, these interactions become
   harder to analyze, increasing the risk of security issues.
3. **Regression risk**: Mixed changes are more likely to introduce
   regressions in existing functionality. These regressions may go
   undetected during testing if the focus is primarily on new
   functionality.
4. **Deployment risks**: Complex changes carry higher deployment risks.
   If issues emerge in production, rollbacks become more difficult
   because reverting the functional change also means reverting
   potentially beneficial refactoring.
5. **Incident response challenges**: When production issues occur, the
   complexity of mixed changes makes root cause analysis more difficult
   and time-consuming, extending the impact of incidents.

### Business and Project Impacts

The technical and team challenges ultimately translate to business
impacts:

1. **Reduced predictability**: Projects become less predictable as the
   complexity of changes increases the likelihood of unexpected issues
   and delays.
2. **Increased maintenance costs**: The accumulation of technical debt
   from mixed changes leads to higher ongoing maintenance costs,
   reducing resources available for new development.
3. **Feature delivery delays**: As teams spend more time managing the
   complexity of mixed changes, feature delivery timelines extend,
   potentially affecting market competitiveness.
4. **Quality perception issues**: When mixed changes lead to subtle
   bugs or regressions, customer perception of product quality can
   suffer, affecting retention and satisfaction.
5. **Opportunity costs**: Perhaps the most significant business impact
   is the opportunity cost of engineering resources diverted to
   managing complexity rather than delivering value.

These multifaceted impacts underscore the importance of maintaining
software engineering discipline even as development becomes increasingly
AI-assisted. Organizations that recognize and address these challenges
proactively can harness the productivity benefits of LLMs while
mitigating their risks.

### Measurement Framework for LLM-Assisted Development

To effectively manage these impacts, organizations need comprehensive
metrics that track both the benefits and risks of LLM-assisted
development:

#### Quality Metrics

**Code Complexity Trends**:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Track changes in complexity before and
  after LLM modifications
- **Halstead Volume**: Measure cognitive effort required to understand
  code changes
- **Depth of Inheritance**: Monitor increases in class hierarchy
  complexity
- **Coupling Metrics**: Assess component interdependence changes

**Defect Correlation Metrics**:
- **Change-Defect Correlation**: Track defect rates by change type
  (mixed vs. separated)
- **Review Effectiveness**: Measure issue detection rates in different
  change types
- **Time-to-Resolution**: Track how quickly issues from different
  change types are resolved

#### Process Efficiency Metrics

**Review Metrics**:
- **Review Duration**: Time spent reviewing mixed vs. separated changes
- **Review Iterations**: Number of review cycles required
- **Approval Confidence**: Reviewer confidence scores for different
  change types

**Development Velocity**:
- **Feature Delivery Time**: End-to-end time for feature implementation
- **Rework Frequency**: Rate of changes requiring significant revision
- **Integration Complexity**: Difficulty of merging changes

#### Implementation Guidelines

Organizations implementing these metrics should:

1. **Establish Baselines**: Measure current performance before
   introducing systematic LLM practices
2. **Set Thresholds**: Define acceptable complexity and defect rate
   changes
3. **Regular Review Cycles**: Monthly assessment of metric trends
4. **Tool Integration**: Automate metric collection through CI/CD
   pipelines
5. **Team Feedback Loops**: Use metrics to guide training and process
   improvements

## Solutions and Mitigations

While the challenges of maintaining preparatory refactoring discipline
with LLMs are significant, they can be effectively addressed through a
combination of technical approaches, process changes, and organizational
practices. This section provides practical, actionable strategies for
different stakeholders.

### LLM Prompting Strategies

One of the most direct approaches is to improve how we instruct LLMs
when requesting code changes.

#### Research-Based Prompting Frameworks

Recent academic research has validated specific prompting strategies:

**Structured Context Provision**: Studies show that providing explicit
refactoring subcategories in prompts increases success rates from 15.6%
to 86.7%. This involves:
- Defining specific refactoring operations (Extract Method, Move Method, etc.)
- Providing examples of acceptable vs. unacceptable changes
- Explicitly stating behavior preservation requirements

**The CRISP-DM Adaptation for Code Changes**: Researchers have adapted
the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) for LLM
code modification:
1. **Business Understanding**: Define why the change is needed
2. **Code Understanding**: Analyze current structure
3. **Data Preparation**: Prepare code for modification
4. **Modeling**: Apply refactoring patterns
5. **Evaluation**: Verify behavior preservation
6. **Deployment**: Implement functional changes

**Explicit Staged Prompting**

Instead of asking for the entire change at once, explicitly break the
request into stages:

```
I need to update this payment processing function to use the new API. 
Let's approach this in two steps:

STEP 1: First, please refactor the code to separate the API-specific logic 
from the business logic WITHOUT changing any functionality. Only make 
structural improvements that will make the API change easier.

After I review this refactoring, we'll proceed with step 2 to update the API.
```

This staged approach forces the separation of concerns and allows for
proper review between steps.

**Scope Limitation Instructions**

Clearly define boundaries for what the LLM should and should not modify:

```
Please fix the import errors in this file. 

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
1. ONLY modify the import statements at the top of the file
2. DO NOT add type annotations
3. DO NOT modify function implementations
4. DO NOT change formatting or whitespace
5. DO NOT add new functionality
```

Explicit constraints help overcome the LLM's tendency to make additional
improvements.

**Context Segmentation**

Provide only the relevant parts of the code to limit the scope of
potential changes:

```
I'm going to show you ONLY the import statements from my file 
that need to be fixed. Please update these imports to use the 
new module names without making any other changes.

Here are the current imports:
```

By limiting the context, you reduce the likelihood of unrelated changes.

**Explicit Refactoring Requests**

When refactoring is desired, specify the exact refactorings to perform:

```
Please refactor this code using ONLY the following refactoring operations:
1. Extract the file reading logic into a separate function
2. Rename the variables to follow our naming convention
3. DO NOT make any other changes or improvements
```

This approach leverages the LLM's capabilities while maintaining control
over the scope.

### Process and Workflow Improvements

Beyond better prompting, process changes can help maintain proper
engineering discipline.

**Two-Phase Code Generation Workflow**

Implement a formal two-phase workflow for LLM-assisted changes:

1. **Refactoring Phase**:
   - Explicitly request only refactoring changes
   - Review and commit these changes
   - Verify through tests that behavior is preserved

2. **Functional Change Phase**:
   - Request only the functional changes needed
   - Review these separately from the refactoring
   - Test the new functionality independent of structural changes

This approach institutionalizes the preparatory refactoring pattern
within the development process.

**Differential Review Practices**

Adapt code review practices for LLM-generated changes:

- Use split-screen views to compare original, refactored, and
  functionally changed versions
- Review refactoring and functional changes in separate sessions
- Develop checklists specifically for evaluating refactoring
  correctness
- Implement "concern tagging" to mark which parts of a change are
  refactoring vs. functional

**Change Staging and Isolation**

Use version control practices that support proper separation:

- Create separate branches for refactoring and functional changes
- Use interactive staging to selectively commit refactoring changes
  separately from functional changes
- Leverage git's patch mode to carefully select specific changes
- Implement pre-commit hooks that check for mixed refactoring and
  functional changes

**Documentation of Intent**

Explicitly document the intent behind each change:

```javascript
/**
 * REFACTORING: Extracted file reading logic to improve testability
 * No functional changes intended
 */
function readConfigFile(filePath) {
    // Implementation
}
```

This documentation helps reviewers and future developers understand the
purpose of each change.

### Technical Solutions

Several technical approaches can help maintain proper separation of
concerns.

#### Modern Measurement and Analysis Frameworks

**Complexity Monitoring Systems**: Current industry-standard tools for
2024 include:
- **Static Analysis Platforms**: Tools like Codacy and DeepSource that
  automatically track cyclomatic complexity, with reports showing 15%
  better critical issue detection rates
- **Real-time Complexity Dashboards**: Systems that monitor complexity
  trends, with successful implementations showing 25% reductions in
  average complexity scores
- **Coupling Analysis Tools**: Enterprise-grade solutions that identify
  interdependencies and suggest refactoring boundaries

**RefactoringMirror Methodology**: Recent research has developed the
"detect-and-reapply" tactic called RefactoringMirror to avoid unsafe
refactorings. This approach:
- Identifies potentially unsafe modifications before application
- Validates behavior preservation through automated testing
- Provides rollback mechanisms for problematic changes
- Reports 92% reduction in functionality-altering refactorings

**Automated Refactoring Tools**

Leverage specialized tools that perform well-defined refactoring
operations:

- IDE refactoring features (Extract Method, Rename, etc.)
- Language-specific refactoring tools like Python's Rope or
  JavaScript's jscodeshift
- Linters and formatters to handle style improvements separately from
  functional changes

These tools can be used before or after LLM-generated changes to
properly separate concerns.

**Change Classification Systems**

Develop or adopt tools that classify changes by type:

- Static analysis to distinguish between structural and behavioral
  changes
- Semantic diff tools that highlight potential behavior changes
- Systems that flag mixed refactoring and functional changes for
  special review

Such tools can provide automated guidance during the review process.

**Behavioral Testing Frameworks**

Implement testing approaches that verify behavior preservation:

- Approval testing to capture and verify outputs before and after
  refactoring
- Characterization tests that document existing behavior before
  changes
- Differential testing that compares outputs of original and
  refactored code
- Property-based testing to verify invariants are maintained

These testing approaches provide confidence that refactoring has
preserved behavior.

**AI-Assisted Verification**

Use additional AI systems to verify changes:

- Secondary LLMs to review changes made by primary LLMs
- Specialized models trained to detect behavior changes
- AI systems that explain the potential impact of changes
- Multi-agent setups with separate refactoring and verification agents

This approach leverages AI capabilities to counterbalance the
limitations of individual LLMs.

#### Industry-Standard Toolchain for 2024-2025

**Integrated Development Environments**:
- **VS Code Extensions**: New extensions specifically designed for LLM
  collaboration that enforce staging workflows
- **IntelliJ IDEA Plugins**: Tools that visualize change types and
  provide warnings for mixed concerns
- **Cursor IDE Features**: Built-in separation of refactoring and
  functional change modes

**Static Analysis Integration**:
- **SonarQube Rules**: Custom rules that flag commits mixing refactoring
  and functional changes
- **Codacy Integration**: Automated complexity tracking that alerts on
  concerning trends
- **DeepSource Workflows**: AI-powered code review that specializes in
  change classification

**Version Control Integration**:
```bash
# Pre-commit hook example for change separation validation

class ChangeMetrics:
    def __init__(self, git_repo):
        self.repo = git_repo
        
    def analyze_commit(self, commit_hash):
        """
        Analyze a commit for change type classification
        """
        diff = self.repo.get_commit_diff(commit_hash)
        
        metrics = {
            'complexity_delta': self.calculate_complexity_change(diff),
            'coupling_impact': self.assess_coupling_changes(diff),
            'behavior_preservation': self.verify_behavior_preservation(diff),
            'change_classification': self.classify_change_type(diff)
        }
        
        return metrics
```

### Role-specific Guidance

Different stakeholders need specific strategies for addressing these
challenges.

**For Developers**

1. **Request design**: Learn to craft explicit, staged requests to
   LLMs:
   - Break changes into explicit refactoring and functional steps
   - Provide clear constraints and boundaries
   - Review intermediate outputs before proceeding

2. **Active review**: Develop habits of careful review for
   LLM-generated code:
   - Use diff tools to identify unrelated changes
   - Question every change to understand its purpose
   - Be willing to reject and refine changes that mix concerns

3. **Testing discipline**: Maintain strong testing practices:
   - Write tests before requesting changes
   - Verify that refactoring preserves behavior
   - Test functional changes independently

#### Developer Toolkit and Best Practices

**Daily Workflow Integration**:
```bash
# Example daily workflow for LLM-assisted development
# 1. Analysis phase
git checkout -b feature/payment-validation
llm-analyze --scope src/payment.py --request "add input validation"

# 2. Refactoring phase
llm-refactor --preserve-behavior --extract-methods src/payment.py
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: extract validation methods for readability"
pytest --behavior-verification

# 3. Functional change phase
llm-implement --add-feature "input validation" src/payment.py
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive input validation"
pytest --full-suite
```

**Code Review Checklist**:

## Conclusion

The challenge of maintaining preparatory refactoring discipline in the
age of LLMs represents a critical inflection point in software
development practices. As we've explored throughout this chapter, the
natural behavior of LLMs---to combine refactoring and functional changes
into a single step---directly conflicts with established best practices
that separate these concerns for improved quality and maintainability.

The blog post from AI Blindspots accurately identifies a core issue:
"Current LLMs, without a plan that says they should refactor first,
don't decompose changes in this way. They will try to do everything at
once." This seemingly technical observation has profound implications
for code quality, maintainability, and the future of software
engineering.

### Key Lessons

Several critical insights emerge from our analysis:

1. **The problem is methodological, not just technical**: The clash
   between preparatory refactoring principles and LLM behavior is not
   merely a limitation of current AI systems but a fundamental tension
   between different approaches to code modification.
2. **Mixed changes create compound risks**: When refactoring and
   functional changes combine, they create increased complexity,
   reduced reviewability, and higher defect potential---turning what
   should be straightforward changes into risky endeavors.
3. **Current processes are insufficient**: Standard development
   practices and tools aren't yet adapted to address these challenges,
   leading to degraded code quality even in otherwise well-engineered
   systems.
4. **Solutions require multi-faceted approaches**: Addressing this
   challenge requires combinations of improved prompting, process
   changes, tool support, and organizational practices.
5. **The future is collaborative**: As LLM capabilities evolve, the
   most effective approach will be neither complete reliance on AI nor
   rejection of its benefits, but thoughtful collaboration that
   leverages the strengths of both humans and AI.

### Essential Actions

For different stakeholders, several key actions emerge as particularly
important:

**For Developers**:
- Break changes into explicit refactoring and functional steps
- Learn to craft clear, constraint-based prompts for LLMs
- Develop critical review skills for identifying mixed concerns
- Practice and advocate for staged implementation approaches

**For Technical Leaders**:
- Establish clear workflows that separate refactoring from functional
  changes
- Invest in tools and infrastructure that support proper separation
- Create educational resources and guidelines for LLM collaboration
- Implement review processes specialized for different change types

**For Tool Developers**:
- Build LLM interfaces that support staged implementation
- Develop verification tools for behavior preservation
- Create visualization approaches that highlight different change
  types
- Design systems that enforce separation of concerns

**For Organizations**:
- Recognize the quality implications of different development
  approaches
- Balance short-term productivity with long-term code maintainability
- Invest in training and skill development for the AI era
- Establish policies and standards for responsible LLM use

### Balancing Efficiency and Quality

Despite the challenges, it's important to recognize that LLMs offer
substantial benefits for code modification:

- They can implement complex changes more quickly than manual coding
- They can suggest improvements that might not be obvious to
  developers
- They can reduce the burden of routine coding tasks
- They can make development more accessible to those with less
  experience

The goal isn't to avoid LLMs in software development but to harness
their capabilities while mitigating their risks. Organizations that
develop effective strategies for maintaining engineering discipline
while leveraging LLMs will gain competitive advantages in both
productivity and quality.

### Connection to Broader Software Engineering Principles

The challenge of preparatory refactoring with LLMs connects to
fundamental principles in software engineering:

- It reinforces the importance of separation of concerns as a core
  design principle
- It highlights the ongoing tension between short-term productivity
  and long-term maintainability
- It demonstrates how essential human judgment remains in an
  increasingly automated field
- It shows how engineering discipline must adapt to technological
  change without abandoning its core principles

These connections emphasize that while tools and technologies evolve,
the fundamental principles of good software engineering remain relevant.
The challenge is adapting how we apply these principles to new contexts.

### Looking Forward

As we navigate this transition, several principles can guide our path
forward:

1. **Respect engineering wisdom**: The preparatory refactoring pattern
   emerged from decades of software engineering experience. This wisdom
   remains valuable even as our tools change.
2. **Adapt thoughtfully**: We need to evolve our processes and
   practices to work effectively with AI assistants, finding the right
   balance between human and machine contributions.
3. **Invest in education**: Developing new skills and understanding
   around LLM collaboration is essential for maintaining quality in the
   AI era.
4. **Measure what matters**: Beyond simple productivity metrics,
   organizations need to track quality indicators that show the
   long-term impact of different development approaches.
5. **Share knowledge widely**: The challenges of maintaining
   engineering discipline with LLMs affect the entire industry and
   benefit from collaborative solutions.

By addressing the challenge of preparatory refactoring with LLMs
thoughtfully and systematically, we can ensure that the productivity
benefits of AI-assisted development don't come at the expense of code
quality and maintainability. The approaches we develop today will shape
software engineering practices for the coming decades, making this a
critical moment for the development community to engage with these
issues.

### The Path Forward: Evidence-Based Development

The integration of recent research findings provides a clear roadmap:

1. **Quantified Benefits**: Organizations implementing systematic
   separation practices report 25% improvements in development velocity
   and 20% reductions in defect rates
2. **Measurable Quality**: Modern complexity metrics provide objective
   guidance for maintaining code quality during AI-assisted development
3. **Tool Evolution**: The emergence of specialized tools for LLM
   collaboration creates opportunities for better engineering discipline
4. **Academic Partnership**: Ongoing research initiatives provide
   evidence-based approaches to these challenges

### Industry Standards Emergence

As this field matures, we can expect:

- **Standardized Metrics**: Industry adoption of complexity and quality
  metrics specifically designed for LLM-assisted development
- **Certification Programs**: Professional development programs focusing
  on effective LLM collaboration techniques
- **Regulatory Considerations**: Potential regulatory frameworks for
  AI-assisted code modification in safety-critical systems
- **Open Source Toolchains**: Community-driven tools that embed best
  practices for preparatory refactoring with LLMs

As AI increasingly permeates development practices, maintaining proper
engineering discipline becomes not just a technical challenge but a
fundamental requirement for sustainable software development. By
preserving the essence of preparatory refactoring in the age of LLMs—
grounded in empirical research and measurable outcomes—we can build a
future where AI enhances rather than undermines the quality of the
systems we create.

The evidence is clear: teams that maintain separation between refactoring
and functional changes, even when using LLMs, achieve better outcomes.
The challenge now is scaling these practices across the industry while
continuing to innovate in how humans and AI collaborate effectively.
