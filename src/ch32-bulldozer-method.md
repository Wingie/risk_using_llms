# The Bulldozer Method - Using LLMs for Brute Force Problem Solving

## Introduction

In the landscape of software development and problem-solving methodologies, the Bulldozer Method stands as a refreshingly straightforward approach: sometimes, the most effective way to tackle seemingly insurmountable problems is through persistent, methodical effort. As software engineer Dan Luu eloquently described it, "You can achieve results that seem superhuman simply by sitting down, doing the brute force work, and then capitalizing on what you learn to increase your velocity." This chapter explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the ultimate expression of this philosophy, enabling developers to overcome challenges previously dismissed as "too laborious" or "impractical" through sheer computational perseverance.

The integration of LLMs into software development workflows represents a paradigm shift in how we approach complex, tedious, or repetitive tasks. Where human attention inevitably wanes and motivation falters, LLMs maintain unwavering focus, methodically working through problems with consistent precision. This chapter examines how leveraging LLMs as "bulldozers" can transform previously intimidating development challenges into manageable, even routine, endeavors.

### The Origins of the Bulldozer Method

The term "Bulldozer Method" gained prominence through the writings of Dan Luu, a respected software engineer known for his pragmatic approach to complex problems. The core insight behind the method is disarmingly simple: many apparently superhuman achievements are merely the result of consistent, methodical effort applied to problems that others have abandoned due to perceived difficulty or tedium.

Luu observed that in many professional contexts, people frequently overestimate the complexity of certain tasks while underestimating the power of persistent, focused work. The Bulldozer Method eschews sophisticated strategies or clever shortcuts in favor of a more direct approach: systematically working through a problem until it yields. Though conceptually straightforward, this approach often reveals insights and patterns that eventually lead to more efficient solutions---but only after the initial groundwork has been laid through diligent effort.

### The LLM as the Ultimate Bulldozer

Large Language Models represent perhaps the purest embodiment of the Bulldozer Method in action. These systems possess several characteristics that make them ideally suited for brute force approaches:

1. **Tireless Execution**: Unlike humans, LLMs don't experience fatigue, boredom, or motivation loss when performing repetitive tasks. They can execute the same operation thousands of times with perfect consistency.
2. **Speed and Scale**: Modern LLMs can process and generate text at a pace far exceeding human capabilities, allowing them to rapidly work through large volumes of code or documentation.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: While applying brute force methods, LLMs simultaneously analyze patterns and can identify optimization opportunities that emerge from repeated operations.
4. **Context Awareness**: Advanced LLMs maintain awareness of larger project contexts while executing granular tasks, ensuring that brute force approaches remain aligned with overarching goals.
5. **Adaptability**: When a particular approach proves ineffective, LLMs can rapidly pivot to alternative strategies based on accumulated feedback.

The combination of these attributes makes LLMs exceptionally powerful tools for implementing the Bulldozer Method in software development contexts. They can systematically address problems that human developers might avoid due to the sheer volume of repetitive work involved.

### Identifying Bulldozer Opportunities

One of the key insights from the Bulldozer Method is recognizing opportunities where brute force approaches can yield impressive results. These opportunities often appear in areas previously deemed "too much work" for human developers to tackle efficiently. When working with LLMs, it's valuable to develop a keen eye for such opportunities:

#### 1. Large-Scale Refactoring Projects

Codebase refactoring often requires consistent changes across hundreds or thousands of files. Such projects can be daunting for human developers but represent ideal scenarios for LLM-powered bulldozing. Examples include:

- Migrating from one API or framework to another
- Standardizing code patterns across a legacy codebase
- Implementing consistent error handling throughout an application
- Updating deprecated function calls across an entire project

#### 2. Type System Migrations and Adjustments

As mentioned in our opening example, strongly typed languages like Haskell or Rust create cascading update requirements when core types change. When a fundamental type signature changes, every function that uses it directly or indirectly must be updated. LLMs excel at:

- Following type error chains systematically
- Implementing consistent fixes across the codebase
- Understanding complex type relationships
- Maintaining semantic consistency while updating types

#### 3. Test Suite Maintenance and Generation

Test maintenance represents another excellent bulldozer opportunity:

- Updating expected values in test cases
- Generating exhaustive test cases for edge conditions
- Modernizing legacy tests to use current testing frameworks
- Creating comprehensive test coverage for previously untested code

#### 4. Documentation and Comment Generation

Documentation requirements can be overwhelming, particularly for large projects:

- Creating consistent API documentation across hundreds of endpoints
- Updating documentation to reflect code changes
- Translating documentation into multiple languages
- Adding explanatory comments to complex legacy code

#### 5. Data Transformation and Migration

Data processing tasks that require consistent, repetitive operations are ideal for LLM bulldozing:

- Converting between data formats (JSON to CSV, XML to JSON)
- Normalizing inconsistent data structures
- Implementing data validation rules across large datasets
- Migrating database schemas while preserving data integrity

By recognizing these patterns, developers can strategically deploy LLMs to address challenges that might otherwise remain perpetually on the "someday" list due to their labor-intensive nature.

### Implementing the Bulldozer Method with LLMs

Successfully implementing the Bulldozer Method with LLMs requires a structured approach. The following framework provides a starting point for effectively applying brute force techniques to complex problems:

#### 1. Problem Decomposition

Before unleashing an LLM on a problem, break it down into well-defined components:

- Identify the specific repetitive tasks involved
- Determine input and output requirements for each task
- Establish success criteria for the overall process
- Document any constraints or edge cases the LLM should consider

This decomposition serves two purposes: it makes the problem more tractable and it creates natural checkpoints for verifying the LLM's progress.

#### 2. Initial Pattern Establishment

Begin by working through several examples manually or with direct LLM guidance:

- Solve a few instances of the problem with careful attention to process
- Document the decision-making steps and patterns that emerge
- Identify potential variations or exceptions to the standard pattern
- Create a template or prompt that captures the essential approach

This initial investment in pattern establishment pays dividends by ensuring the LLM applies a consistent, correct methodology across all instances of the problem.

#### 3. Incremental Execution with Verification

Rather than processing the entire problem space at once, implement an incremental approach:

- Have the LLM process a small batch of the problem
- Verify results against expected outcomes
- Adjust prompts or guidance based on any discrepancies
- Gradually increase batch size as confidence in the process grows

This incremental approach minimizes the risk of propagating errors and allows for ongoing refinement of the bulldozing process.

#### 4. Pattern Recognition and Optimization

As the LLM works through the problem, actively monitor for emerging patterns or shortcuts:

- Look for repetitive operations that could be optimized
- Identify clusters of similar cases that could be processed together
- Note exceptions or edge cases that require special handling
- Consider whether general rules can replace case-by-case decision making

This step embodies a core principle of the Bulldozer Method: the process of methodical work often reveals optimizations not apparent at the outset.

#### 5. Documentation and Knowledge Capture

Throughout the bulldozing process, maintain comprehensive documentation:

- Record successful prompt patterns and methodologies
- Document edge cases and their resolutions
- Capture any domain insights gained through the process
- Create reusable templates for similar future problems

This documentation transforms the brute force effort into a knowledge asset that can accelerate future work, both for human developers and for subsequent LLM-assisted projects.

### Case Study: Type System Refactoring

Let's examine a concrete example of the Bulldozer Method applied to a challenging software development scenario: refactoring a Rust application after changing a core type definition.

#### The Challenge

In a medium-sized Rust application, the development team needed to modify a central data structure from using a simple String identifier to using a custom ResourceId type with additional validation and metadata capabilities. This change would cascade through hundreds of functions across dozens of files, requiring consistent updates to function signatures, variable declarations, and method calls.

Traditional approaches to this problem included:

1. **Manual refactoring**: Tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming
2. **Partial implementation**: Limiting the scope of the change to reduce complexity
3. **Clever IDE tools**: Helpful but unable to handle semantic nuances

#### The Bulldozer Approach

The team implemented the Bulldozer Method using an LLM assistant with the following process:

1. **Problem Definition**: They created a clear specification of the type change, including:

- Original type: String
- New type: ResourceId
- Conversion functions: String::from(resource_id) and ResourceId::from(string)
- Context-dependent rules for choosing the appropriate conversion

2. **Initial Pattern Establishment**: They manually refactored several representative functions with the LLM observing, then documented the patterns that emerged:

- Function parameter updates
- Return type changes
- Variable declaration modifications
- Conversion function insertion points

3. **Incremental Execution**: The LLM was then configured to:

- Process one file at a time
- Generate a diff of proposed changes
- Await developer review before proceeding
- Learn from corrections when mistakes were identified

4. **Compiler Integration**: The team implemented a feedback loop where:

- After each file was updated, the Rust compiler was run
- Any resulting errors were fed back to the LLM
- The LLM would analyze the errors and propose further fixes

5. **Pattern Optimization**: As the process continued, the LLM identified common patterns:

- Functions that simply passed the identifier through could use generic type parameters
- Certain function clusters could be updated together due to their interdependencies
- Some complex conversions could be simplified by introducing helper functions

#### Results

The outcome demonstrated the power of the Bulldozer Method:

- The team completed the refactoring in approximately 20% of the originally estimated time
- The resulting code maintained consistent patterns throughout the codebase
- The process revealed several design improvements that were implemented during refactoring
- Developers reported learning deeper insights about their codebase structure through the process

This case study illustrates how embracing the brute force nature of the problem---systematically updating each affected component---actually led to more elegant solutions than might have emerged from trying to cleverly avoid the work.

### Case Study: Automated Test Updates

Another illustration of the Bulldozer Method's effectiveness involves the maintenance of extensive test suites with hard-coded expected values.

#### The Challenge

A data processing application included hundreds of unit tests with expected output values coded directly into the tests. When the core algorithm was optimized, it produced slightly different numerical results (more accurate, but different enough to fail all existing tests). The team faced updating thousands of expected values across the test suite.

#### The Bulldozer Approach

The team implemented an LLM-driven solution:

1. They created a simple prompt pattern instructing the LLM to:

- Run each test and capture the actual output
- Compare it to the expected output
- Update the hard-coded expected values if the difference fell within acceptable tolerances
- Flag tests with significant discrepancies for human review

2. The LLM systematically processed each test file:

- Running the tests
- Updating expected values
- Committing changes with detailed commit messages explaining the nature of each update
- Moving to the next file

3. Throughout this process, the LLM maintained a log of:

- Tests updated
- Magnitude of each change
- Tests flagged for review
- Patterns in the changes that might indicate systemic issues

#### Results

This approach transformed what would have been days of tedious manual updates into an overnight automated process. Moreover, the systematic nature of the updates revealed patterns in the algorithm changes that helped the team better understand the impact of their optimization work.

### Pitfalls and Limitations

While the Bulldozer Method with LLMs offers powerful solutions to complex problems, it comes with important limitations and potential pitfalls:

#### 1. Lack of Critical Assessment

Unlike humans, LLMs don't naturally question whether they're solving the right problem or using the most efficient approach. They will happily continue applying brute force to problems that might be better solved through structural changes or different methodologies.

**Mitigation**: Regularly pause the bulldozing process to critically assess whether the current approach remains optimal. Set explicit checkpoints for human review.

#### 2. Error Propagation

When using LLMs for brute force tasks, errors in understanding or implementation can propagate widely before detection. An incorrect pattern applied consistently across thousands of instances can create substantial technical debt.

**Mitigation**: Implement robust validation mechanisms, including compiler checks, unit tests, and periodic manual reviews. Start with small batches and verify thoroughly before scaling up.

#### 3. Context Limitations

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs still face context window limitations that can constrain their ability to maintain awareness of the entire problem space.

**Mitigation**: Carefully structure problems to fit within context limitations, use incremental approaches that maintain critical context, and implement systems to track global state outside the LLM.

#### 4. Over-reliance on Brute Force

The ease with which LLMs apply brute force approaches can create a temptation to use them for problems better solved through more elegant solutions.

**Mitigation**: Establish clear criteria for when bulldozing is appropriate versus when architectural reconsideration is needed. Use bulldozing as a tool, not a default methodology.

#### 5. Missing Emergent Patterns

LLMs might not always recognize emergent patterns that would allow for optimization of the brute force approach.

**Mitigation**: Implement explicit pattern-seeking prompts and human review stages focused on identifying optimization opportunities.

### Best Practices for LLM Bulldozing

To maximize the effectiveness of the Bulldozer Method with LLMs while minimizing risks, consider these best practices:

#### 1. Start with Clear Specifications

Before applying brute force, ensure you have a precisely defined problem statement:

- Explicit input and output specifications
- Clear success criteria
- Documented constraints and edge cases
- Examples of correct implementations

This foundation prevents wasted effort and reduces the risk of propagating misunderstandings.

#### 2. Implement Robust Verification

Build verification into the bulldozing process:

- Automated tests to validate each change
- Compiler or linter checks where applicable
- Sampling mechanisms for human review
- Comparative analysis against expected patterns

Verification serves as guardrails for the bulldozing process, preventing it from veering into incorrect territory.

#### 3. Create Feedback Loops

Establish mechanisms for the LLM to learn from its work:

- Feed errors back into the prompt context
- Update guidance based on discovered edge cases
- Refine the approach as patterns emerge
- Allow the LLM to suggest process improvements

These feedback loops enable the bulldozing process to improve organically over time.

#### 4. Document Everything

Comprehensive documentation transforms one-time brute force work into reusable intellectual capital:

- Record the problem definition and approach
- Document pattern discoveries and optimizations
- Create templates for similar future challenges
- Capture domain insights gained through the process

This documentation serves as a knowledge repository that accelerates future development work.

#### 5. Balance Automation and Oversight

Strike the right balance between automation and human oversight:

- Fully automate truly repetitive, well-understood tasks
- Implement human checkpoints for strategic decisions
- Allow the LLM to suggest when human intervention might be valuable
- Gradually increase automation as confidence in the process grows

This balanced approach leverages the strengths of both LLMs and human developers.

### The Future of LLM Bulldozing

As LLM technology continues to evolve, we can anticipate several developments that will enhance the effectiveness of the Bulldozer Method:

#### 1. Increased Context Windows

Expanding context windows will allow LLMs to maintain awareness of larger problem spaces, enabling more holistic bulldozing approaches that consider broader system implications.

#### 2. Specialized Coding Models

Models specifically optimized for code understanding and generation will bring deeper semantic awareness to bulldozing tasks, reducing errors and enabling more sophisticated refactoring operations.

#### 3. Integration with Development Environments

Tighter integration between LLMs and development environments will create seamless workflows where bulldozing becomes a natural extension of the development process rather than a separate activity.

#### 4. Multi-modal Capabilities

The ability to process and generate multiple types of content---code, documentation, diagrams, tests---will enable more comprehensive bulldozing that addresses all aspects of a development challenge simultaneously.

#### 5. Learning from Collective Experience

LLMs that can learn from the collective experience of bulldozing efforts across many projects will develop increasingly sophisticated heuristics for identifying patterns and optimization opportunities.

These advancements promise to make the Bulldozer Method even more powerful, transforming it from a brute force necessity into a sophisticated problem-solving approach that combines methodical execution with continuous learning and optimization.

### Conclusion: Embracing the Power of Persistence

The Bulldozer Method, as applied through LLMs, represents a profound shift in how we approach development challenges. It reminds us that sometimes, the most effective solution is not the cleverest algorithm or the most elegant architecture, but rather the persistent application of straightforward effort guided by incremental learning.

By embracing LLMs as our bulldozers, we gain the ability to tackle problems previously deemed too laborious or tedious for human attention. We convert what would have been weeks of monotonous effort into hours of guided automation, freeing human developers to focus on the creative and strategic aspects of software development that truly require human insight.

Perhaps most importantly, the Bulldozer Method teaches us to look for opportunity in the mundane---to recognize that what appears to be "too much work" might actually represent an untapped opportunity for competitive advantage. By methodically addressing challenges that others avoid due to perceived effort, organizations can achieve outcomes that appear superhuman to outside observers.

As we continue to integrate LLMs into our development workflows, the distinction between "brute force" and "elegant solution" may increasingly blur. What begins as systematic bulldozing often reveals patterns and insights that lead to more refined approaches. The very act of persistent effort becomes a path to discovering elegant solutions that might never have emerged from theoretical consideration alone.

In this light, the Bulldozer Method with LLMs represents not just a tactical approach to specific challenges, but a strategic mindset that embraces the transformative power of persistent, methodical effort applied at scale. It reminds us that sometimes, the most direct path to seemingly superhuman results is simply showing up, day after day, and moving the earth one scoop at a time---only now, we have machines that can move mountains.
