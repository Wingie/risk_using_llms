# Part I Enhancement Prompt: Core LLM Security Vulnerabilities (Chapters 1-10)

## Part I Overview
**Focus**: Attack vectors and fundamental vulnerabilities in LLM systems  
**Audience**: Security professionals, AI developers, system architects  
**Approach**: Practical threat analysis with concrete examples and defensive guidance

## Part I-Specific Guidelines

### **Attack Vector Presentation Standards**
Each vulnerability chapter should follow this pattern:

1. **Real-World Incident**: Start with documented attack/breach
2. **Technical Mechanics**: How the attack works at a technical level  
3. **Business Impact**: Quantified damage and organizational consequences
4. **Detection Methods**: How to identify this vulnerability class
5. **Mitigation Strategies**: Practical defensive measures
6. **Prevention Framework**: Systemic approaches to avoid the vulnerability

### **Case Study Integration**
- **Primary case study**: Major, well-documented incident
- **Supporting examples**: 2-3 additional real-world instances
- **Industry focus**: Travel, finance, healthcare examples preferred
- **Damage quantification**: Always include financial/operational impact
- **Timeline analysis**: How attacks unfold over time

### **Technical Depth Guidelines**
- **Code examples**: Working exploits and defenses (properly sanitized)
- **Architecture diagrams**: Clear visualization of attack pathways  
- **Tool recommendations**: Specific security tools and frameworks
- **Testing procedures**: How security teams can test for vulnerabilities
