### O'Reilly Voice Transformation

#### Before (Generic AI Voice)
> "Data poisoning attacks can be challenging to detect and may require sophisticated detection methods."

#### After (O'Reilly Professional Voice)
> "As NIST's 2024 adversarial ML report notes, 'most of these attacks are fairly easy to mount and require minimum knowledge of the AI system.' Poisoning attacks can be mounted by controlling just a few dozen training samples—often less than 0.1% of the entire training set—making them both accessible to attackers and difficult for defenders to detect."
